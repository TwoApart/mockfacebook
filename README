mockfacebook is a mock HTTP server for Facebook's FQL and Graph API.

mockfacebook can be used in place of the live Facebook servers as an FQL and
Graph API endpoint. It supports the full FQL query language and all Graph API
endpoints except writing. It can download and uses data from live Facebook, or
you can enter your own data.

mockfacebook includes an automated utility that reads the Facebook developer
docs and example data, infers and stores the current FQL and Graph API schemas,
assists with building a schema mapping, and generates test data. This helps it
stay up to date in the face of Facebook's rapid iteration and API changes. (It's
also better than the Graph API's `?metadata=true`, which is often wrong or out
of date because it's written by hand, not auto-generated from the real schema.)

mockfacebook is backed by SQLite. It's single threaded, so it's not suitable for
load testing, high throughput, or performance. If you need any of that, try
!FriendRunner (http://www.friendrunner.com/).

Depends on webapp2 (http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/) and sqlparse
(http://code.google.com/p/python-sqlparse/). webapp2 comes bundled as a git
submodule. Here are commands to download and set up sqlparse:

{{{
# in the mockfacebook dir
wget http://python-sqlparse.googlecode.com/files/sqlparse-0.1.3.tar.gz
tar xzf sqlparse-0.1.3.tar.gz
ln -s sqlparse-0.1.3/sqlparse sqlparse
}}}
